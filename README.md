# Metro-System-application-using-dijkstras
This system allows us to find the shortest path and fare between the stations. 
It also includes the service of creating a metro card. Each metro card has unique id. We can recharge the metro card and can get the information about the current balace,
new balance(after recharge or deduction) and also the information if the balance is insufficient to travel.
